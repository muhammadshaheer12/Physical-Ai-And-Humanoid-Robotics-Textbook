I am unable to remove any pull requests as I could not create them in the first place due to permission errors.

Regarding your request to "comment and commit the code in my GitHub repository":

1.  **Commenting Code**: I still need clarification on which specific files or sections of code you would like me to add comments to. The files I created (`spec.md`, `requirements.md`, `phr.md`) are documentation, and the shell scripts (`create-new-feature.sh`, `create-phr.sh`) had their line-ending fixes committed to a separate branch. Please tell me which code files you are referring to.

2.  **Committing Code**: All the work I have done, including the feature specification and the script fixes, has already been committed to their respective branches (`002-physical-ai-robotics-textbook` and `3-fix-bug`) and pushed to the remote repository. My `main` branch is currently clean and up-to-date with the remote.

    Do you want me to:
    *   Merge the `002-physical-ai-robotics-textbook` branch into `main`?
    *   Merge the `3-fix-bug` branch into `main`?
    *   Do you have other uncommitted changes (e.g., in `robotics-ai-book/README.md`) that you want me to commit and push? If so, please specify the files.

Please provide clear instructions on how you'd like me to proceed.
