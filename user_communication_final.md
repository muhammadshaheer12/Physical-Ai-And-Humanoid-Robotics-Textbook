I have successfully pushed all committed code to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.

Regarding your request to "comment my code", I still need clarification. Please specify which files or sections of code you would like me to add comments to. The files that were part of the recent commits (specifications, prompt history records, and the shell scripts) are either documentation or scripts that had their line endings fixed, and do not typically require extensive inline code comments in the traditional sense.

Please let me know if there are specific code files you want me to review and add comments to.
