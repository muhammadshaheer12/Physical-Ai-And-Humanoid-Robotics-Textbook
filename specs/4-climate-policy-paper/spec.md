# Feature Specification: Research Paper on Climate Policy Solutions (Post-2015)

**Feature Branch**: `4-climate-policy-paper`  
**Created**: 2025-12-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Project: Research Paper on Climate Policy Solutions (Post-2015) Intent: Analyze and compare climate policy solutions adopted since 2015 for an undergraduate economics audience. Please review the specification to identify: - Ambiguous terms (e.g., what qualifies as a “policy solution” or “effectiveness”) - Missing assumptions (citation style, paper structure, tone, level of economic analysis) - Incomplete requirements (handling conflicting evidence, revision process, evaluation metrics) - Scope conflicts (historical overview vs. current policy analysis, global vs. regional focus) Identify gaps or unclear requirements that must be resolved before planning the paper structure and writing begins."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-12-25
- Q: What specific criteria define a "policy solution" for inclusion? → A: Broadly defined: Include government-mandated regulations, market-based mechanisms (e.g., carbon pricing), and international agreements.
- Q: What are the primary metrics for evaluating "effectiveness" of policies? → A: Balanced: Emissions reduction, economic impact, and feasibility.
- Q: What specific economic models or frameworks are expected for the economic analysis? → A: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA): Focus on a comprehensive evaluation of policy costs versus benefits.
- Q: Should the paper focus on specific regions or a broader global overview of policy types? → A: Broader global overview of policy types: Focus on the general characteristics and economic implications of different policy types across various contexts.
- Q: Which citation style should be used? → A: APA Style: American Psychological Association style, common in social sciences.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Undergraduate Student Researches Policy Solutions (Priority: P1)

An undergraduate economics student uses the research paper to understand and compare climate policy solutions adopted since 2015. They can identify key policies, their mechanisms, and their economic impacts.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and core purpose of the paper.

**Independent Test**: An undergraduate student can read the paper and articulate the main climate policy solutions discussed and their comparative economic implications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an undergraduate economics student reads the paper, **When** they finish, **Then** they can identify at least three distinct climate policy solutions discussed.
2. **Given** an undergraduate economics student reads the paper, **When** they compare policies, **Then** they can describe the economic trade-offs of at least two policies.

### User Story 2 - Instructor Evaluates Paper Quality (Priority: P1)

An economics instructor evaluates the research paper for its analytical depth, clarity, and adherence to academic standards suitable for an undergraduate audience.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the paper meets its academic objective and audience expectations.

**Independent Test**: An instructor can assess the paper against a rubric for undergraduate economics research, finding it to meet or exceed expectations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an instructor reviews the paper, **When** they check for analytical rigor, **Then** the paper provides clear economic analysis for each policy discussed.
2. **Given** an instructor reviews the paper, **When** they assess academic standards, **Then** the paper adheres to a consistent citation style and presents a clear, logical structure.
