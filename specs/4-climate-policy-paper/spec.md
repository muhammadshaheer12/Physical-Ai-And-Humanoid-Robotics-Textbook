# Feature Specification: Research Paper on Climate Policy Solutions (Post-2015)

**Feature Branch**: `4-climate-policy-paper`  
**Created**: 2025-12-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Project: Research Paper on Climate Policy Solutions (Post-2015) Intent: Analyze and compare climate policy solutions adopted since 2015 for an undergraduate economics audience. Please review the specification to identify: - Ambiguous terms (e.g., what qualifies as a “policy solution” or “effectiveness”) - Missing assumptions (citation style, paper structure, tone, level of economic analysis) - Incomplete requirements (handling conflicting evidence, revision process, evaluation metrics) - Scope conflicts (historical overview vs. current policy analysis, global vs. regional focus) Identify gaps or unclear requirements that must be resolved before planning the paper structure and writing begins."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Undergraduate Student Researches Policy Solutions (Priority: P1)

An undergraduate economics student uses the research paper to understand and compare climate policy solutions adopted since 2015. They can identify key policies, their mechanisms, and their economic impacts.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary audience and core purpose of the paper.

**Independent Test**: An undergraduate student can read the paper and articulate the main climate policy solutions discussed and their comparative economic implications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an undergraduate economics student reads the paper, **When** they finish, **Then** they can identify at least three distinct climate policy solutions discussed.
2. **Given** an undergraduate economics student reads the paper, **When** they compare policies, **Then** they can describe the economic trade-offs of at least two policies.

### User Story 2 - Instructor Evaluates Paper Quality (Priority: P1)

An economics instructor evaluates the research paper for its analytical depth, clarity, and adherence to academic standards suitable for an undergraduate audience.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the paper meets its academic objective and audience expectations.

**Independent Test**: An instructor can assess the paper against a rubric for undergraduate economics research, finding it to meet or exceed expectations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an instructor reviews the paper, **When** they check for analytical rigor, **Then** the paper provides clear economic analysis for each policy discussed.
2. **Given** an instructor reviews the paper, **When** they assess academic standards, **Then** the paper adheres to a consistent citation style and presents a clear, logical structure.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The paper MUST analyze and compare climate policy solutions adopted since 2015.
- **FR-002**: The paper MUST be written for an undergraduate economics audience.
- **FR-003**: The paper MUST define what constitutes a "policy solution" within its context. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific criteria define a "policy solution" for inclusion? e.g., government-mandated, market-based, international agreements?]
- **FR-004**: The paper MUST define metrics for evaluating "effectiveness" of policies. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the primary metrics for effectiveness? e.g., emissions reduction, economic impact, equity, feasibility?]
- **FR-005**: The paper MUST address potential conflicting evidence regarding policy outcomes.
- **FR-006**: The paper MUST include economic analysis appropriate for an undergraduate level. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific economic models or frameworks are expected? e.g., cost-benefit analysis, general equilibrium, specific sectoral models?]
- **FR-007**: The paper MUST maintain a clear, academic tone.
- **FR-008**: The paper MUST cover policies with a global perspective. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the focus be on specific regions or a broader global overview of policy types?]
- **FR-009**: The paper MUST follow a consistent citation style. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which citation style should be used? e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Climate Policy Solution**: A defined action or set of actions aimed at mitigating or adapting to climate change.
-   **Economic Audience**: Undergraduate students of economics.
-   **Effectiveness Metrics**: Measures used to evaluate the success or impact of a policy.
-   **Conflicting Evidence**: Data or studies presenting differing conclusions on policy outcomes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The paper clearly identifies and analyzes at least 5 distinct climate policy solutions adopted post-2015.
