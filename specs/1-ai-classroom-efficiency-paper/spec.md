## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Administrator Efficiency Analysis (Priority: P1)

As a school administrator, I want to read a research paper that clearly explains how AI can improve classroom efficiency, so that I can make informed decisions about technology adoption and resource allocation.

**Why this priority**: Administrators are the primary audience and decision-makers for AI adoption.

**Independent Test**: The paper can be evaluated on its ability to provide clear, evidence-backed insights into AI's impact on classroom efficiency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator reads the paper, **When** they are looking for evidence-based use cases, **Then** they should find at least 3 distinct, well-supported examples.
2. **Given** an administrator is concerned about ROI, **When** they read the paper, **Then** they should be able to understand the potential efficiency gains and return on investment.

### User Story 2 - Policymaker Policy Formulation (Priority: P2)

As a policymaker, I want to understand the tangible benefits of AI in K-12 education, so that I can develop and advocate for policies that support effective technology integration in schools.

**Why this priority**: Policymakers influence the broader educational landscape and funding.

**Independent Test**: The paper's effectiveness can be measured by its clarity and the strength of its evidence in supporting policy decisions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a policymaker reads the paper, **When** they need to justify a policy decision, **Then** they should be able to cite credible evidence from the paper.
2. **Given** a policymaker is assessing the impact on student outcomes, **When** they read the paper, **Then** they should find a clear analysis of how AI can improve student learning.
