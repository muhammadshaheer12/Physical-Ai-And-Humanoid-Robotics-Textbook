# Specification Quality Checklist: Research Paper on AI’s Impact on K–12 Classroom Efficiency

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-22
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md]

<!-- This section checks the quality of the specification content. -->
## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

<!-- This section checks the completeness of the requirements. -->
## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

<!-- This section checks if the feature is ready for implementation. -->
## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

<!-- This section contains any additional notes. -->
## Notes
