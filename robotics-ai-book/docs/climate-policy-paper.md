# Climate Policy Solutions (Post-2015)

## Introduction

This section will provide an introduction to the research paper on climate policy solutions adopted since 2015. It will define the scope, purpose, and key questions the paper aims to address, setting the stage for an undergraduate economics audience.

## Defining and Measuring Climate Policy

This section will define what constitutes a "policy solution" within the context of climate change, including government-mandated regulations, market-based mechanisms, and international agreements (FR-003). It will also cover the primary metrics for evaluating the "effectiveness" of these policies, focusing on emissions reduction, economic impact, and feasibility (FR-004).

## Policy Solutions

This section will summarize the individual policy solutions and direct the reader to the detailed analysis in the sub-pages.

## Comparative Analysis and Discussion

This section will compare the analyzed policies, highlighting their mechanisms, economic impacts, and discussing at least 3 economic trade-offs per policy (SC-003). It will integrate findings from the individual policy analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of their comparative effectiveness and implications.

## Conclusion

This section will summarize the key findings of the research paper, reiterate the main arguments, and address any conflicting evidence regarding policy outcomes (FR-005). It will offer a concluding perspective on the effectiveness and future directions of climate policy solutions.
